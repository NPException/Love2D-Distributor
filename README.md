### What the do you mean with "loose package"
That is a zip containing the unmodified `love.exe` and `.dll` files, the game source folder, and a batch file to run the game.

I implemented this variant so I could send the zipped, playable game to our artist who needs to replace assets quickly. That way, he would not have to manually unzip the `.love` file.
